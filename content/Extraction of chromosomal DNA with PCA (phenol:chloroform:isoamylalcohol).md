This protocol is quick but also dirty. There should be considerable amounts of phenol in the final preparation.
Do not use for E. coli transformation, the phenol kills the E.coli.

- Glass beads (~150 µL)

- 150 µL TE 10 X

- 150 µL PCA (phenol : chloroform : isoamyl alcohol at proportion 25:24:1) (Plant lab)

- 20 sec Fast Prep (or 5 min; max rpm; in the LGM disruptor)

- Centrifuge 10 min 14 000 rpm

- DNA is in the upper phase

- Dilute 10x and check in the NANODROP

- Use it as a template.
