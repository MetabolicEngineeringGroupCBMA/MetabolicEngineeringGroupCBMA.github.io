Potassium chloride is used for some media formulations. It is available as an anhydrous salt with a molecular weight of 74.5513 g/mol. Solubility in water at 0 C is 280 g/L which makes 3.5 M the highest practical concentration for a stock solution.

### 3.5 M KCl
Mix 26,092955 g KCl with 70 mL water. Mix by a magnetic stirrer bar. Add water to 100 mL.
Sterilize by autoclave.
