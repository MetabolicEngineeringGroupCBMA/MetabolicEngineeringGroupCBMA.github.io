Magnesium sulfate is used in PCR and as a growth medium component for some formulations.

Magnesium sulfate comes in several common forms:

- anhydrous 120.366 g/mol
- hexahydrate MgSO4x6H2O 228.46 g/mol
- heptahydrate MgSO4x7H2O 246.48 g/mol

Anhydrous MgSO4 has a solubility of 269 g/L at 0 °C. This means that about 2M is the highest practical stock solution
concentration. Make a 2M solution like so:

Weigh 49.3 g MgSO4x7H2O and dissolve in 100 mL water.
Sterilize by autoclaving. This solution can be stored at room temperature.
Some protocols recommend filter sterilization, but this [one](http://cshprotocols.cshlp.org/content/2006/1/pdb.rec8110.full?text_only=true) seem to allow for autoclaving.
