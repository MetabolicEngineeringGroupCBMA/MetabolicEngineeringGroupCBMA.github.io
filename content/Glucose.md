# 40% glucose (20x, 400 g/L):

The strongest possible stock concentration is 50% (w/v) = 500 g/L = 2.78 M. This solution easily precipitates, so we prepare 40% solutions instead.

A volume of 2.5 mL (40% = 3 x 834 µL) of this solution is needed for 50 mL [[YPD]] to make 2% Glucose.

Glucose MW is 180.16 g/mol.

1. Put 500 ml deionized H20 in a large beaker with a stir bar. NOTE: DO NOT ADD THE POWERED GLUCOSE BEFORE THE WATER OR IT WILL GO SOLID.

2. Place 500 ml of water on stir/hot plate and turn on heat and start stirring. Allow water to get warm, but not boiling.

3. Add 400 g of glucose (dextrose). NOTE: IT TAKES A FEW MINUTES TO GO INTO SOLUTION.

4. Bring volume up to 1 liter with deionized H20

5. Aliquot 50 mL into 100 mL Schott bottles (approx. 20 bottles per liter)

6. Loosen caps on bottles, autoclave.

7. After autoclaving, allow cool to room temperature, tighten caps and store on media shelf.
