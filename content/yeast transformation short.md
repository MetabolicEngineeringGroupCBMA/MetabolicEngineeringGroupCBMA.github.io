### LAB3 (3h, Week 3)
![[10000001000001F600000190492E49BB8EC7AF88.png]]

This practical class consists of three separate tasks.

1.  Prepare a DNA mixture.
2.  Yeast transformation using the DNA mix
3.  Assemble the final plasmid on your computer.

### Preparation of DNA mixes

Each student should prepare a mixture of the PCR products obtained in
the previous class. The teacher has pooled all the successful PCR
reaction in their respective
categories:
![](100000000000021200000212B5A626992F307D65.png)

1.  ampR
2.  pBR
3.  ΔCRP
4.  CEN\_ARS / 2µ
5.  LEU2 / TRP1 / HIS3 / TRP1

The specific PCR reactions used can be found in the \"**DNA\_pool**\"
tab of the **Google sheet**. There is one 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube with
each component. There is \*\*only one\*\* tube of each kind, so share
the tubes in a **practical** way between groups.

Each student should prepare the DNA mixture outlined in the
\"**TRAFO\_plan**\" tab of the Google sheet. Note that some students
prepare a mix with **five** components (we call this the "+" mix) and
some with **four** components and **water** (we call this the ∆ mix).
The delta (∆) mix has all the components *except the pBR* fragment.

1.  Calculate how much is needed of the + and ∆ mixes (count the number
    of students with each mix)
2.  Each student need 40 µL of mixture = 5 components \* 8 µL
3.  Prepare the mixture in a fresh Eppendorf tube and mix well.
4.  Prepare one fresh Eppendorf tube for each student.
5.  Mark these tubes with the \"TRAFO\#\" numbers. These numbers can be
    read from the Google sheet, tab \"TRAFO\_plan\"
6.  Divide 40 µL mix into the correct tubes with the correct numbers.

This is the **only** material available, so be **sure** to pipette the
correct volumes and do **not** contaminate the tubes as other students
will use them.

### Yeast transformation

Each student should make one transformation.

1\. Take two new 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes.

2\. Transfer 1 mL \*\*ultra pure water\*\* to one tube and put it on
ice. Cold water is needed later in the protocol.

3\. Transfer 50 µL of the cell suspension to the other tube. Mark this
tube with your \"TRAFO\#\" number.

4\. Centrifuge the cells for 20s at the highest speed.

5\. Remove supernatant with a P200 pipette. Leave the cell pellet at the
bottom of the tube, do \*\*not\*\* resuspend.

6\. Add 30 µL of your \*\*DNA mix\*\* (+ or ∆ )to the tube with cells.

7\. Add 150 µL PLS (PEG-LiAc-ssDNA) Be careful and pipette slowly as PLS
is sticky. Using a P1000 pipette might be easier than using a P200.

8\. Vortex the tubes until the cells are well resuspended.

9\. Put the tubes in a floating tube rack at 42°C.

10\. Incubate for 40 min.

11\. During this time you should do the DNA assembly on your computer.

12\. Mark a Petri dish with the appropriate solid medium with your
\"TRAFO\#\" number and name. Write on the back side, not on the lid.

13\. Add about 1/2 mL glass spheres (\~10-15 spheres) to one empty Petri
dishes with solid medium.

14\. Remove tube from water bath after 40 min and put on ice for at
least 2 min.

15\. Spin tube for 20s at highest speed.

16\. Remove supernatant with a P200 pipette. Leave the cell pellet at
the bottom of the tube.

17\. Add 100 µL cold water (from the tube on ice, step 1) and resuspend
with the pipette by \*\*slowly\*\* pipetting up and down.

18\. Transfer all of the cell suspension to yout Petri dish.

19\. Spread the cells by shaking the glass spheres (The samba method).

20\. Incubate the plates upside down for 2-3 days at 30°C.
