If you work with several different media such as [[YPD]], [[LB]], [[SOB]] and
[[SOC]] liquid and solid it might pay off to separate the solutions to a
smaller set that can be combined to form each medium.

For this reason, you can prepare a sterile >twice concentrated agar solution
in a Schott flask. These can be kept at room temperature almost indefinitely.

For 500 mL solid medium (~20 plates):
- 1 L Schott flask
- 10 g Agar
- ~200 mL water
- Optional a magnetic stirrer bar
Sterilize by autoclaving.

Add water and media components to 500 mL and heat in a microwave oven (5-10 min) until the agar has been dissolved.
