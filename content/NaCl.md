Sodium chloride is used as a medium component for [[LB]] medium. NaCl has a solubility of 357 g/L at 0C in water.
The molecular weight is 58.44 g/mol. This means that about 6M or 350,64 g/L is the strongest practical stock solution.

We prepare a 25% (250 g/L) or 4.28 M:
- 50 g NaCl
- water to 200 mL

Sterilize by autoclaving. This solution should have an eternal shelf life.

This solution is  50 x concentrated for [[LB]]-Lennox, 25 x for LB-Miller and 500 x for LB-Low Salt.
