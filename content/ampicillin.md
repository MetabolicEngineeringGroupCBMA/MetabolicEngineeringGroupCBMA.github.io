# Ampicillin stock solution

How to prepare Protocol for ampicillin 100 mg/ml stock solution stock (x 1000).

* Weigh 1 g ampicillin sodium sulfate powder (Fisher 1760-25) in a Falcon 15 mL tube.
* Add water to the 10 mL mark and vortex. Add more water if necessary.
* Filter through 0.22 µM membrane with a large syringe.
* store at -20 in 1 ml aliquots.

Final concentration for E. coli should be 100 µg/ml. We often use twice that to be on the safe side. This is 2-10 times the recommended by ATCC (see below), but the higher concentration avoid satellite colonies.
# Geneticin(G418) stock solution 200 mg/mL (x 1000).

Geneticin (Gibco's brand name) or G418 (generic name) is used to select for yeast that have the KanMX resistance marker.
We make G418 stock solution at 200 mg/ml (1000x) and use a final concentration of [200 μg/ml](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10514571) in solid or liquid media.
The working solution is stored in 1 mL aliquots marked with a capital ***"G"*** at -20°C.
Put these tube is the box marked **"Antibiotics"** in the -20 freezer.

### Tetracycline 12.5 mg/ml
Add 125 mg Tetracycline Hydrochloride (MW = 480.898 g/mol) powder to a 15 mL FALCON tube.
Add 7 mL of Ethanol 99.5 or 96%.
Add water to 10 mL.
Aliquot 1 mL per tube and store at -20C.
For XL1-Blue use 12.5 µg/mL Tetracycline.
