# Antibiotics
Final concentrations generally recommended.

- 100  µg/mL Ampicillin (*E. coli*)
- 12.5 µg/mL Tetracycline (*E. coli*)
- 50 µg/ml Kanamycin (*E. coli*)
- 100 µg/mL G418 (*S. cerevisiae*)

# Ampicillin stock solution (100 mg/ml = 1000X concentrated)
How to prepare Protocol for ampicillin 100 mg/ml stock solution stock (x 1000).

- Weigh ~1 g ampicillin sodium sulfate powder (Fisher 1760-25) in a Falcon 50 mL tube.
- Add water to the 10 mL mark and vortex. Adjust the volume with water if necessary.
- Filter through 0.22 µm membrane with a new syringe.
- Store at -20 in 1 ml aliquots.

Final concentration for E. coli should be 100 µg/ml. This is close to the upper
limit recommended by ATCC (see below). The stock solution is stored in 1 mL
aliquots marked with a capital **"A"** at -20°C in the box marked **"Antibiotics"** in the -20 freezer.

# Kanamycin stock solution (50 mg/ml = 1000X concentrated)

- Weigh ~1 g  1 gram of Kanamycin sulfate in a Falcon 50 mL tube.
- Add water to the 20 mL mark and vortex. Adjust the volume with water if necessary.
- Filter through 0.22 µm membrane with a new syringe.
- Store at -20 in 1 ml aliquots.

Final concentration for E. coli should be 50 µg/ml. This is the upper
limit recommended by ATCC (see below).The stock solution is stored in 1 mL
aliquots marked with a capital **"K"** at -20°C in the box marked **"Antibiotics"** in the -20 freezer.

# Geneticin (G418) stock solution (200 mg/ml = 1000X concentrated)

Geneticin (Gibco's brand name) or G418 (generic name) is used to select for yeast that have the *Kan*MX resistance marker.

- Weigh ~2g G418  powder in a Falcon 50 mL tube.
- Add water to the 10 mL mark and vortex. Adjust the volume with water if necessary.
- Filter through 0.22 µm membrane with a new syringe.
- Store at -20 in 1 ml aliquots.

Final concentration for E. coli should be 200 µg/ml. This is less than half of the lower limit concentration recommended by
ATCC (see below). The concentration was recommended by [Goldstein & McCusker 1999](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10514571)
The stock solution is stored in 1 mL aliquots marked with a capital **"G"** at -20°C in the box marked **"Antibiotics"** in the -20 freezer.

# Tetracycline stock solution (12.5 mg/ml = 1000X concentrated)

- Add 125 mg Tetracycline Hydrochloride (MW = 480.898 g/mol) powder to a 15 mL FALCON tube.
- Add 7 mL of Ethanol 99.5% or 96%.
- Add water to 10 mL.
- Aliquot 1 mL per tube and store at -20°C.

It is not necessary to sterile filter this solution since it is made in 70% Ethanol. For E. coli XL1-Blue, use 12.5 µg/mL Tetracycline. The stock solution is stored in 1 mL aliquots marked with a capital **"T"** at -20°C in the box marked **"Antibiotics"** in the -20 freezer.
# Hygromycin B stock solution (250 mg/ml = 1000X concentrated)

Standard concentration for selection in *S. cerevisiae* is 300 µg/ml, we use 250 µg/ml. Stock solution is 250 mg/mL (x 1000):

- Weigh 2.5 g Hygromycin B powder in a Falcon 15 mL tube.
- Add water to the 10 mL mark and vortex. Add more water if necessary.
- Filter through 0.22 µM membrane with a new syringe.
- Store at -20 in 1 ml aliquots.

The 300 µg/ml selection concentration was recommended by [Goldstein & McCusker 1999](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10514571). The stock solution is stored in ~1 mL aliquots marked with a capital **"H"** at -20°C in the box marked **"Antibiotics"** in the -20 freezer.

# Nourseothricin (clonNAT)  stock solution (100 mg/ml = 1000X concentrated)

Nourseothricin is a mixture of Streptothricins C, D, E and F and can be used as selection antibiotic for a broad spectrum of pro- and
eukaryotic organisms (i.e. Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, yeast, filamentous fungi, protozoa, micro algae, plants and more.

- Weigh 1 g clonNAT powder in a Falcon 15 mL tube.
- Add water to the 10 mL mark and vortex. Add more water if necessary.
- Filter through 0.22 µM membrane with a new syringe.
- Store at -20 in 1 ml aliquots.

The concentration was recommended by [Goldstein & McCusker 1999](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10514571)  The stock solution is stored in 1 mL aliquots marked with a capital **"N"** at -20°C in the box marked **"Antibiotics"** in the -20 freezer.
