The **KanMX4 marker** is a widely used selection marker in molecular biology, particularly in yeast genetics. It consists of a *kanamycin resistance gene* from *Escherichia coli* fused to a promoter and terminator sequences that are functional in yeast. The gene confers resistance to the antibiotic G418 (geneticin), which allows for the selection of cells that have successfully integrated the KanMX4 marker into their genome.

This system is especially valuable in gene knockout experiments, where the marker is used to replace or disrupt a target gene, facilitating the study of gene function. The KanMX4 cassette is versatile and can be used in various organisms, making it a powerful tool in genetic engineering and functional genomics. For example, it confers resistance in E. coli to kanamycin.

The KanMX4 gene originated from the [Tn903](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/V00359) transposon.

The most popular version of this resistance gene combines the marker with the translation elongation factor 1α gene of *Ashbya gossypii* promoter and terminator. This combination is called "KanMX4".
