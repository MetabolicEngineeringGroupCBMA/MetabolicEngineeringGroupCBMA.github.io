# High competent cells from liquid culture (Flávio?)

Grow yeast in 250 ml YEPD until A600 is 0.2-0.8. There are two ways to do this:
Inoculate the YEPD with a patch of yeast in the afternoon and grow O/N at room temperature.
Inoculate the YEPD with an overnight culture to A600 of ~0.1 and grow at 30°C for ~4hrs.
Before starting:
boil salmon sperm DNA (10µg/µl) for 5 min an put on ice.
prepare TE/LiAc
prepare TE/LiAc/PEG
Spin at 1800 rpm, 20°C for 5 min.
Resuspend in 50ml sterile H2O at RT.
Spin at 1800 rpm, 20°C for 5 min.
Resuspend in 10ml TE/LiAc at RT.
Spin again.
Resuspend in TE/LiAc in a total volume of 1 ml per 0.1 OD600.
Low competent cells from yeast on a plate

Scrape a patch of cells off a plate.
Resuspend in 1 ml TE/LiAc.
Spin, resuspend in 50µl TE/LiAc.
Add 1µg plasmid, 5µl freshly boiled salmon spermDNA (10µg/µl) and 300 µl TE/LiAc/PEG.
Incubate at 30°C for 30 min.
Incubate at 42°C for 15 min.
Spin, resuspend in 200µl H2O and plate.
