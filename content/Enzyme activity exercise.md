Microbiol. Biotechnol._ 53 (4): 376–82. [https://doi.org/10.1007/s002530051629](https://doi.org/10.1007/s002530051629).

The XK reaction was coupled with the pyruvate kinase reaction as follows:

xylulose + ATP ⟶ xylulose 5-phosphate + ADP
ADP + phosphoenolpyruvate ⟶ pyruvate + ATP
pyruvate + NADH ⟶ lactate + NAD

The reaction mixture contained the following:
50 mM TRIS/HCl bufferr (pH 7.5),
2.0 mM MgCl2,
2.0 mM ATP,
0.2 mM phosphoenolpyruvate,
0.2 mM NADH,
10 U pyruvate kinase (E.C. 2.7.1.40),
10 U lactate dehydrogenase (E.C. 1.1.1.27)
8.5 mM xylulose.

Consumption of NADH was measured spectrophotometrically at 340 nm.

The molar absorption coefficient (extinction coefficient) of NADH at 340 nm (ε<sub>340</sub>) is 6220 M-1 cm-1, whereas that of NAD<sup>+</sup> at the same wavelength can be assumed to be 0.

# Beer-Lambert Law

The Beer-Lambert Law describes the linear relationship between the absorbance of a solution and the concentration of the absorbing species in the solution.

## Formula

The equation is given by:

**A = ε * c * l**

where:

- **A** = Absorbance (no units)
- **ε** = Molar absorptivity or extinction coefficient (L·mol⁻¹·cm⁻¹)
- **c** = Concentration of the solution (mol·L⁻¹)
- **l** = Path length through the sample (cm)

## Explanation

- **Absorbance (A)** is the amount of light absorbed by the solution.
- **Molar absorptivity (ε)** is a constant that depends on the nature of the absorbing species and the wavelength of light.
- **Concentration (c)** is the amount of the absorbing species per unit volume.
- **Path length (l)** is the distance that light travels through the solution.

The Beer-Lambert Law is often used in spectrophotometry to determine the concentration of a solute in a solution by measuring the absorbance.


The concentration of protein in the extract was 2.6 mg/mL.
