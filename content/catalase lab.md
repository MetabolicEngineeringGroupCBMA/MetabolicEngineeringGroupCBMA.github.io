## Catalase measurement in permeabilized yeast cells

Catalase is an enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen.

![Figure-1](catalase.png)

Figure 1

The aim of this practical class is to measure the activity of catalase in permeabilized [*Saccharomyces cerevisiae*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccharomyces_cerevisiae) yeast cells.

## Background

Acyl-CoA oxidase is the first enzyme in the peroxisomal β-oxidation pathway, responsible for catalyzing the oxidation of acyl-CoA, a process that breaks down fatty acids.


![[catalase lab-20241030065447199.png]]

Figure 2

Unlike in mitochondria, where FADH₂ would enter the electron transport chain, peroxisomal FADH₂ directly donates its electrons to molecular oxygen, leading to the formation
of hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) instead (Figure 2). This step is unique to peroxisomal β-oxidation since, in mitochondria, electron carriers like FADH₂ contribute to ATP synthesis through oxidative phosphorylation. In peroxisomes, however, FADH₂ is quickly oxidized back to FAD, enabling continuous fatty acid oxidation but producing H₂O₂ as a byproduct instead of ATP.

![[catalase lab-20241030065724928.png]]

Figure 3

Complex I and III can inadvertently leak electrons to molecular oxygen (Figure 3), forming superoxide. The superoxide anion (O₂⁻•​) generated in Complex I and III of the mitochondrial electron transport chain is detoxified primarily by the enzyme **superoxide dismutase (SOD)**.

![[catalase lab-20241030070256864.png]]

Figure 4

NOX1 and NOX2 are enzymes that belong to the NADPH oxidase (NOX) family, which play crucial roles in producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) as part of cell signaling and immune responses (Figure 4). Unlike mitochondrial ROS generation, these enzymes generate ROS directly at the cell membrane or within specific cellular compartments.

### NOX1

- **Location**: Primarily expressed in epithelial cells, including those in the colon and vascular smooth muscle cells.
- **Function**: NOX1 generates superoxide (O₂⁻•), which can be converted into other ROS, such as hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂).
- **Role in Cellular Function**: Involved in cell signaling related to cell proliferation, migration, and immune responses. NOX1 is also implicated in vascular remodeling, inflammatory responses, and some forms of cancer progression, where ROS play a role in cell growth signaling.

### NOX2

- **Location**: Most well-known for its role in phagocytic cells (like neutrophils and macrophages), but it is also expressed in other cell types.
- **Function**: NOX2 is crucial for the immune response, as it produces superoxide in phagosomes to destroy ingested pathogens. Superoxide generated by NOX2 contributes to the “respiratory burst,” a rapid release of ROS that kills bacteria and other pathogens.
- **Role in Host Defense**: NOX2-derived ROS are critical in antimicrobial defense. Inherited defects in NOX2 lead to impaired ability to fight off infections.

Figure 5

Glutathione (GSH) removes hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) through an enzymatic reaction involving **glutathione peroxidase (GPx)** (Figure 5).
This enzyme catalyzes the reduction of H₂O₂ to water, using glutathione as the electron donor.

1. **Reduction of Hydrogen Peroxide**: Glutathione peroxidase uses two molecules of reduced glutathione (GSH) to convert hydrogen peroxide into water. GSH is oxidized to form glutathione disulfide (GSSG).
2. **Regeneration of Glutathione**:  To maintain a steady supply of reduced glutathione (GSH), **glutathione reductase (GR)** recycles GSSG back to GSH using NADPH as a reducing agent:


### The catalase tes

[![catalase](<catalase lab-20241031103259320.png>)](https://youtu.be/SBmL2vg-IN0?si=g4FuyzAxANuq77Rm&t=124)

Figure 6

The catalase test is a simple biochemical assay used to identify organisms capable of producing the enzyme catalase. All known aerobic microorganisms produce catalase. In the test (Figure 6), a small amount of bacterial culture is exposed to hydrogen peroxide, and the presence of bubbles indicates a **positive** result, signifying catalase activity. This test is commonly used to differentiate between catalase-positive organisms, like *Staphylococcus* spp., and catalase-negative organisms, such as *Streptococcus* spp. in clinical microbiology.


## Assay

The protocol is based on a combination of a method for preparing permeabilized yeast cells with ethanol described by [Trawczyńska & Wójcik 2015](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26019618/)
and an assay for peroxide using cobalt ions described by [Hadwan 2018](https://bmcbiochem.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12858-018-0097-5).

After the cells have been permeabilized, substrate such as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> can more easily reach the catalase enzyme and the products (H<sub>2</sub>O and O<sub>2</sub>) can
more easily leave (Figure 7).


![[permyeast2.png]]

Figure 7



The permeabilization protocol is very simple. The yeast cells are incubated with ethanol for 20 min in a phosphate buffer.

Permeabilized yeast cells are mixed with hydrogen peroxide and incubated for 10 min at 37°C.  During this time some of the hydrogen peroxide is consumed by catalase and broken down to oxygen and water.

The remaining peroxide is measured by allowing the hydrogen peroxide to oxidize cobalt(II) to cobalt(III) which can be measured with a spectrophotometer at 440 nm (Figure 8).
The oxidation is performed in the presence of carbonate ions which causes a pink complex with cobalt(II) and a green complex with cobalt(III).

## How to calculate catalase activity

All absorbance values are taken with a spectrophotometer calibrated against air *without* a [[cuvette]] (Figure 10).

The **S**tandard reaction in Figure 9 contains only hydrogen peroxide and and cobalt(II) carbonate. All of the available peroxide should oxidize cobalt(II) to cobalt(III). The **T**est reactions contain H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and cells. Some of the peroxide should have been consumed by the catalase in the cells, so the absorbance value at 440 nm should be lower than for the **S**tandard reaction.
$$\Delta A =  \boldsymbol{S}tandard_{Abs440nm} - \boldsymbol{T}est_{Abs440nm}$$
The absorbance that we should have observed for the consumed H₂O₂ is the absorbance for the **S**tandard reaction minus the absorbance of the **T**est reaction. We would expect a higher absorbance for the Test 2 reaction, since less cells should have consumed less peroxide.

![[catalase lab-20241030134016670.png]]

Figure 9

We use a standard curve (Figure 10) to calculate the actual concentration of the samples. The activity is then calculated from the concentration difference between the Standard and the sample divided by the reaction time.
## Calibration curve
![Figure-11](Concentration_as_a_function_of_absorbance_at_440_nm.png)
Figure 10

A 10 mM hydrogen peroxide solution was [serially diluted](https://microbenotes.com/serial-dilution/#serial-dilution-formulacalculations) (Figure 11) by first preparing twelve Eppendorf tubes with 300 µL of [[ddH2O]]. One milliliter hydrogen peroxide was transferred to the first tube, the contents were mixed by pipetting up and down 5-6 times followed by transferring 1 mL to the next tube. This means that the last tube (12) eventually had a final volume of 1.3 ,L while all preceding tubes had 300 µL.

The hydrogen peroxide concentration in the first tube is 1 mL * 10 mM/1.3 mL = 7.6923 mM. The dilution factor is the same for all tubes (1/1.3) so the concentration of each tube can be calculated using the formula $10 \times (\frac{1}{1.3})^n$ where n is 1..12.

![Figure-6](serial_dilution.png)

Figure 11

Cuvettes with  210 µL of each dilution were prepared, twelve in total. Working solution (800 µL)  (Series#1 and #2 below, Figure 12) was added to each cuvette followed by 10 min incubation at room temperature under darkness. Two replicates were prepared and the absorbance at 440 nm was measured with a [[GENESYS20]] spectrophotometer.
## Series#1

![Series1](Series1-catalase.jpg)
## Series#2

![Series2](Series2-catalase.jpg)

Figure 12

The absorbance readings were collected in the table below.

| Tube | Concentration (mM) | Series#1 | Series#2 |
|------|---------------|----------|----------|
| 1    | 7.692         | 0.450    | 0.414    |
| 2    | 5.917         | 0.394    | 0.361    |
| 3    | 4.551         | 0.345    | 0.307    |
| 4    | 3.501         | 0.291    | 0.263    |
| 5    | 2.693         | 0.248    | 0.225    |
| 6    | 2.072         | 0.213    | 0.194    |
| 7    | 1.594         | 0.197    | 0.166    |
| 8    | 1.226         | 0.160    | 0.148    |
| 9    | 0.943         | 0.143    | 0.134    |
| 10   | 0.725         | 0.123    | 0.115    |
| 11   | 0.558         | 0.109    | 0.113    |
| 12   | 0.429         | 0.113    | 0.095    |

The average absorbance was plotted against the hydrogen peroxide concentration resulting in a reasonably linear relationship (Figure 10). The graph follows the linear relationship between Concentration (mM) and A<sub>440</sub>:
$$C _{mm} = 20.8  \times A _{440} - 1.95$$


At this point, we have absorbance change or ∆A per 10 min. What we want is µmol / min which is the definition of the [[enzyme activity\|classical unit]].



## Linearity


The protocol specifies two experiments (Figure 6), **T**est**1** and **T**est**2**, where the latter contain half as much cells. If the assay is [[enzyme activity\|linear]], **T**est**1** should produce twice the absorbance compared to **T**est**2**.
