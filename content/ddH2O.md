### ddH2O ( double deionized water )

This is the purest water available in the Department.
This water is also called `ultra-pure` or `agua-ultrapura` in some protocols.

We use this water for:

- molecular biology, PCR, enzyme digestion etc.
- washing and buffers for competent cells

For most applications deionized water [[dH2O]] is pure enough.
