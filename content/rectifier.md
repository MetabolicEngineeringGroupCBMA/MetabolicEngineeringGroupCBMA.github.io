We use a homebuilt rectifier to provide DC (Direct Current) for gel electrophoresis. A rectifier is an electrical device that converts alternating current (AC), which periodically reverses direction, to direct current (DC), which flows in only one direction. It consists of a plastic box and connectors bought in an electronics store. The box contain a full-wave rectifier bridge.

Full-wave rectification converts both polarities of the input waveform to pulsating DC.

It is very easy and [inexpensive](https://pt.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Comchip-Technology/GBPC5010-G?qs=tw%252BuQ%2FB6PO2Qn1Q%2Fn7BShQ%3D%3D&_gl=1*1lapmgk*_ga*MzUzMjEyODQ0LjE3MTExMjMxNjI.*_ga_15W4STQT4T*MTcxMTEyMzE2Mi4xLjAuMTcxMTEyMzE2Mi42MC4wLjA.*_ga_1KQLCYKRX3*MTcxMTEyMzE2Mi4xLjAuMTcxMTEyMzE2Mi4wLjAuMA..) to build (around €5) and does seem to produce the same quality gel images as a normal electrophoresis power source.
