TE buffer is commonly used to redissolve DNA because it contains EDTA. The EDTA will chelate magnesium ions, which are a cofactor for most nucleases (enzymes which degrade nucleic acids). If your DNA prep becomes contaminated with a nuclease (like the ones produced by the cells in your skin) then the nuclease will be inactivated by the fact that the magnesium cofactor is unavailable in the solution (because it is chelated by the EDTA).

Standard TE buffer (x1) has the following composition:

- 10 mM TrisHCl
- 1 mM EDTA

For storage of DNA, pH 8.0 is preferred, for RNA pH 7.5.

TE buffer is normally prepared as a x10 times solution that can be diluted when needed.

- 1L (10X): 3,722 g EDTA .2H2O ; 12,114 g Tris
- 100 mL (10X): 0,3722 g EDTA .2H2O ; 1,2114 g Tris

Set pH with concentrated HCl

TE 10 x concentrated From stock solutions:
- 5 mL 1M [[TrisHCl]] pH 8
- 1 mL 0.5 M [[EDTA]] pH 8

add sterile [[ddH2O]] to 50 mL in a new 50 mL [[glassware\|FALCON]] tube.

(1X):
- 1mM EDTA (292,248 g/mol)
- 10 mM Tris-HCl (121,14 g/mol) pH 8.0
