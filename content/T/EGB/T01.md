# Presentation of the UC and introduction to Bioinformatics.

## What is this course about?

**Engenharia Genética & Bioinformática (EGB)** introduces and integrates **experimental molecular biology** with **computational analysis**.
The goal is to understand how DNA is manipulated in the lab and how biological data are analysed and interpreted using bioinformatics tools.

## Core Concepts

- **Genetic Engineering**
    Manipulation of DNA using molecular biology techniques:
	
    - PCR
    - Manipulation of DNA
    - Cloning vectors
    - Transformation into hosts (_E. coli_, _S. cerevisiae_)
    - Selection and verification (gel electrophoresis, colony PCR, sequencing)

- **Bioinformatics**
    Computational analysis of biological sequences and data:

    - DNA and protein sequence analysis
    - Interpretation of results
    - Linking computational output to biological meaning


👉 The course emphasizes **why and when** to use techniques, not just **how**.

## Course Structure

- **T (Theoretical)** classes
- **TP (Theoretical-Practical)** classes
- **PL (Laboratory Practical)** classes — **mandatory**

A **personal laptop** is required for TP and bioinformatics work.

## Assessmen
Final grade is composed of:

- **30%** – Theoretical Test 1 (blue chapters)
- **30%** – Practical Bioinformatics Tes
- **30%** – Theoretical Test 2 (green chapters + PL content)
- **10%** – TP assignments


 **Attendance and completion of PL are mandatory to pass.**

## Practical Focus
Students are expected to:

- Understand complete **cloning workflows**
- Interpret **PCR, gel, and colony PCR results**
- Work independently with **bioinformatics tools**
- Connect **experimental results** with **in silico analysis**

The practical test evaluates **reasoning and interpretation**, not memorization.

## Skills You Should Gain
By the end of the course, you should be able to:

- Explain DNA manipulation strategies
- Design and analyse cloning experiments
- Use bioinformatics tools critically
- Interpret molecular biology data
- Integrate lab results with computational analysis

## Key Take-Home Message
> Modern biology is both experimental and computational.
> This course trains you to **think across both worlds**, not just follow protocols.


# T1 - Why Gene Cloning and DNA Analysis Are Importan

## What is this class about?
This chapter explains why gene cloning and DNA analysis are central to modern biology, medicine, and biotechnology.
Seminal experiments in genetics. The advent of restriction enzymes and gene cloning. DNA topology, sequence file formats.
PRimary vs secondary databases.

## Core Ideas
- DNA stores the information required for cell structure, function, development, and inheritance.
- Gene cloning allows specific DNA fragments to be isolated and amplified.
- DNA analysis enables comparison, identification, and functional study of genes.

## Why Gene Cloning Is Needed
- Individual genes represent only a tiny fraction of a genome.
- Cloning makes it possible to study genes in detail, produce large amounts of DNA, and express genes in heterologous hosts.

## Applications
- Medicine: diagnostics, genetic diseases, therapeutics
- Biotechnology: recombinant proteins and enzymes
- Research: gene function and regulation
- Agriculture: genetically modified crops

## Key Take-Home Message
Understanding biology at the molecular level requires the ability to clone and analyse DNA.
