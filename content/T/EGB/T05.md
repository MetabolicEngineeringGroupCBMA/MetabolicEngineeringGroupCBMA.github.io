# Summary: T5 - Purification of DNA from Living Cells

## What is this TP about?
This TP explains how to isolate DNA from cells without degradation and in a form suitable for downstream applications.

## Main Steps
1. Cell lysis
2. Removal of proteins and RNA
3. DNA precipitation and purification

## Types of DNA Isolated
- Genomic DNA
- Plasmid DNA
- Total cellular DNA

## Quality Assessment
- DNA concentration
- Purity (A260/A280 ratio)
- Integrity assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis

## Key Take-Home Message
DNA purification is the foundation of all molecular biology workflows.
