# Summary: T2 - DNA structure and manipulation

This class covers how purified DNA is cut, joined, modified, and analysed *in vitro*.
## Core Techniques
- Restriction endonucleases
- DNA ligase
- DNA-modifying enzymes
- Agarose gel electrophoresis

## Key Concepts
- Sticky ends vs blunt ends
- Restriction maps
- DNA fragment size determination
- DNA recovery from gels

## Key Take-Home Message
DNA manipulation relies on enzyme specificity and molecular complementarity.
