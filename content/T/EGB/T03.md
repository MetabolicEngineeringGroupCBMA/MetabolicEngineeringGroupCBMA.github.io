# Summary: T3 - Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)

## What is PCR?
PCR is a technique that amplifies a specific DNA sequence exponentially in vitro.

## Core Components
- Template DNA
- Primers
- DNA polymerase
- dNTPs
- Thermal cycling

## Applications
- Cloning
- Diagnostics
- Mutation detection
- Preparation for sequencing

## Key Take-Home Message
PCR is powerful because it combines specificity with exponential amplification.
