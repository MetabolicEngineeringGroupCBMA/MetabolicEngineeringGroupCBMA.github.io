# Summary: T4 - Cloning Vectors and Host Organisms

This class focuses on how DNA fragments are maintained, replicated, and selected inside living cells.

## Core Concepts
- Cloning vectors are DNA molecules that carry foreign DNA.
- Essential vector features include an origin of replication, a selectable marker, and a cloning site.
- Common vectors include plasmids, bacteriophages, and yeast artificial chromosomes.

## Host Organisms
- Escherichia coli: fast growth and easy genetic manipulation.
- Saccharomyces cerevisiae: eukaryotic host with efficient homologous recombination.

## Selection and Screening
- Antibiotic resistance markers in bacteria.
- Auxotrophic markers in yeast.
- Reporter genes for screening.

## Key Take-Home Message
Successful cloning depends on matching the right vector with the right host.
