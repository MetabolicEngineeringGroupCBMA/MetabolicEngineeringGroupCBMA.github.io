# Summary: T6 - How to clone a new gene

## What is this TP about?
This TP focuses on strategies to isolate one specific gene from a complex genome.

## Approaches
- Genomic libraries
- cDNA libraries
- PCR-based cloning
- Hybridisation-based screening

## Screening Methods
- Colony hybridisation
- PCR screening
- Functional complementation

## Key Take-Home Message
Isolating a gene is a problem of strategy and selection, not chance.
