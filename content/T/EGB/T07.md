# Summary: T7 - Studying Gene Expression and Function

## What is this TP about?
This TP addresses how to study when, where, and how genes are expressed and function.

## Key Techniques
- Reporter genes
- RNA analysis
- Gene knockouts
- Overexpression studies

## Important Concepts
- Gene expression does not always equal gene function.
- Phenotype links genotype to biological role.

## Key Take-Home Message
Knowing a gene sequence is not enough; function must be demonstrated.
