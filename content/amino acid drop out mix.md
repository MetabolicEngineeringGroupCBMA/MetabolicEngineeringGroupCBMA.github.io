# Protocol for making amino acid drop out mixtures for yeast media

This [Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bwC3nxVWoY9LcWObte288kZH9SmRv-DOfGRZ6_5WUQY/edit?usp=sharing) has a detailed recipe.

Use:

- 2.028 g/L of the complete mixture
- 1.388 g/L of the Dropout (-HULT) =  - Histidin Uracile Leucine Trypthophan
- 1.308 g/L of the Dropout (-HULTM) = - Histidin Uracile Leucine Trypthophan Methionine
- 0.640 g/L of the HULT (Histidin, Uracile, Leucine and Tryptophan only)

It can be practical to make stock solutions of amino acids and nucleotides. Some amino acids are not very soluble, using a slightly acid solution usually helps. The data below is from [here](https://www.anaspec.com/html/amino_acids_properties.html). The data for Uracile is from [here](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/uracil).

It is practical to make 50 mL of solution for each component as this fit in our plastic syringes (for filtering).

1. Add about 20-30 mL of hot dH2O water in a 50 mL falcon tube
2. Add the amount specified in the second last column (g/ 50 mL)
3. Shake until dissolved.
4. Add water to 50 mL, the graduation on the Falcon tube has enough accuracy
5. Filter using syringe with 0.2 µM into a sterile Falcon tube
6. Store at room temperature, or the solutions may precipitate.
