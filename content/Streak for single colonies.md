1. Dip the wire loop in the source of bacteria.
2. Streak a zig-zag patter (see ➀ in the image above).
3. Sterilize the loop in a flame and cool on a sterile part of the plate.
4. Run the wire loop trough the end on the previous streak ➁
5. Repeat ➂
6. The objective is to thin out the cells until single colonies are visible (see plate image at the top right)
