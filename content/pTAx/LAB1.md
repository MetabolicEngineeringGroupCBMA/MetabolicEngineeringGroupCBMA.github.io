Summary:
- Plasmid miniprep using alkaline lysis
#### Miniprep

We will prepare four plasmids using alkaline lysis mini prep (see Table#3).  These plasmids are the source for each of the five genetic elements. One plasmid is used as the source of two elements. The last column states why we need each particular plasmid.

| Table#3 | Group | Plasmid   | Source for element |
| ------- | ----- | --------- | ------------------ |
|         | 1     | pBR322    | amp & pBR          |
|         | 2     | pYPKpw    | Δcrp               |
|         | 3     | YIplac204 | TRP1               |
|         | 4     | YEplac195 | 2µ                 |

We will use a homemade alkaline lysis [[alkaline lysis plasmid mini prep\|plasmid miniprep]] protocol. Here is a [[snik-short\|short]] protocol for printing.

The teacher has prepared *E. coli* cultures in liquid or on solid medium beforehand.

Cultures with each plasmid were grown in or on [[LB]] with [[antibiotics]] for selection of the plasmids.

These [videos](https://patharkar.com/2018/10/super-cheap-plasmid-miniprep-without-columns) show how to prepare plasmid DNA from E. coli using basically the same protocol.
