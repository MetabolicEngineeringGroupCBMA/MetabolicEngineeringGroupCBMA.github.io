#### *In-Silico* PCR simulation

The objective of this task is to simulate the outcome  of each of the five PCR product used to make the vector.

1. The primer numbers and template plasmids used can be found in Table#4 above.
2. The template sequences are available through links in [[pTAx assembly strategy#Table 1 Plasmid links\|Table 1]].
3. The primer sequences for each primer number can be found in [[pTAx assembly strategy#Table 3 Primer sequences\|Table 3]].
4. Simulate the PCR products using primer sequences and
5. Add the size and `ldseguid` checksum for each of the PCR products to the LAB5 tab in the course Google sheet.

> [!TIP]
> Before you start, think about the most practical way to solve this task.

#### *In-Silico* Assembly

1. Use the Assembly simulator ([here](https://pydnaweb.streamlit.app/)) to join the five sequences.
2. Annotate your sequence with [pLannotate](http://plannotate.barricklab.org)
3. Add the size and cdseguid checksum for your plasmid as well as the sequence to the LAB5 tab in the Course Google Sheet.


#### Streak plate for colony PCR

Pick one isolated colony with a sterile pipette tip and inoculate a Petri dish with the the appropriate solid medium.
