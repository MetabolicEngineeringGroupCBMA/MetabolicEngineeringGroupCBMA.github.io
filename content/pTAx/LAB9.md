# LAB9 Yeast DNA preparation & *E. coli* transformation (II)

- Prepare crude yeast DNA from cells with glass beads and an *E. coli* plasmid miniprep kif
- Transform *E. coli* with crude yeast DNA
- Plate E. coli on Petri dishes with solid LB-amp medium from LAB7
#### Plasmid preparation from *S. cerevisiae*, one per group
1. (Scrape some yeast cells off a plate)
2. (Add 1 mL water in a 2 mL Eppendorf tube)
3. (Wash cells a and add glass beads)
4. (Add 200 µl of glass beads (about one full 0.2 mL PCR tube) to a tube)
5. (Add the amount of resuspension solution to the cells indicated by the kit)
6. Vortex the tubes for 5 minutes using a [[disruptor genie]].
7. Add the lysis buffer **as soon as possible**, the disruption of the cells liberate nucleases that can damage the DNA.
8. Follow the rest of the alkaline lysis mini-prep kit protocol. [[NZYMiniprep\|mb010_ifu_en_v2401.pdf]].
9. If the kit has an optional wash step to get rid of nucleases, use that.
10. Elute in a small volume 50 µL or 30 µL for higher concentration.

#### E. coli transformations, one per group
1. Add the 10 µL of the plasmid DNA to the tube with competent cells, flick the tube a few times to mix. Do **NOT** vortex the cells at this point.
2. Incubate for up to 30 min on ice.
3. Heat shock in water bath at 42°C during **EXACTLY** 45s.
4. Cool the tube  for 1-2 min in a water/ice slurry for fast heat transfer.
5. Add 1 mL pre-warmed liquid [[LB]] medium to one and proceed to the next step or let cells recover at **37°C** for **1 h** if time allows.
6. Pipette 300 µL of the content to a new Eppendorf tube. Give the remaining cells to the teacher.
7. Add 20 µL ampicillin (x1000) and mix by inversion
8. Pipette all of the content to a LB plate with 10-20 sterile glass beads and swirl the plate to spread the liquid.
9. Incubate plates inverted for 18-24 h at 37°C
