# LAB8 Yeast DNA preparation & *E. coli* transformation

[[material#LAB8]]
Summary:
- Prepare crude yeast DNA from cultures prepared in LAB7.
- Transform *E. coli* with crude yeast DNA.
- Plate E. coli on Petri dishes with solid LB medium from LAB7
#### Plasmid preparation from *S. cerevisiae*, one per student
1. Each student has at least one Eppendorf tube with S. cerevisiae frozen cells from LAB7.
2. Add 200 µL **P1** solution to the frozen cells
3. Add 200 µl of glass beads (about one full 0.2 mL PCR tube).
4. Resuspend cells by [[vortex]]ing briefly.
5. Vortex the tubes for 5 minutes using a [[disruptor genie]].
6. Add 200 µL of **P2** solution (use googles, solution has NaOH). Do this **as soon as possible**, the disruption of the cells liberate nucleases that can damage DNA.
7. Invert tube slowly for 3 min.
8. Add 200 µL **P3** solution.
9. Invert tube slowly for 3 min.
10. Spin (centrifuge) tubes for 10 min at highest speed.
11. While the tubes are spinning, prepare one 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube with 1 mL **96-100% ethanol**
12. Transfer 400-500 µL of the supernatant from the centrifugation to the tube with ethanol.
13. Invert tube slowly ~10 times to mix.
14. Spin (centrifuge) tubes for 10 min at highest speed.
15. Remove all liquid by decanting.
16. Add 1 mL **70% ethanol** to the tube
17. Spin (centrifuge) tubes for 1 min at highest speed.
18. Remove all liquid by decanting.
19. Remove as much liquid as possible with a pipette, spin again if necessary.
20. Dry the DNA for 5 min at **50°C**.
21. Add 50 µL of **TE buffer** to the precipitated DNA and vortex briefly to dissolve.
22. Label your tube with the number in the Google sheet next to your name.
#### E. coli transformations, one per student
1. Add the 10 µL of the plasmid DNA to the tube with competent cells, flick the tube a few times to mix. Do **NOT** vortex the cells at this point.
2. prepare a cup with ice/water slurry.
3. Incubate for 5-10 min on ice.
4. Heat shock in water bath at 42°C during **EXACTLY** 45 s ⏱️.
5. Cool the tube  for 2 min in a water/ice slurry for fast heat transfer.
6. Add 300 µL pre-warmed (37°C) liquid [[LB]] medium.
7. Add 20 µL ampicillin to the cells.
8. Mix cells by pipetting slowly up and down.
9. Plate 200 µL by adding 20 - 30 sterile glass beads to an LB plate and swirl to spread the cells.
10. Incubate inverted at 37°C for 18 - 24 hours.
This protocol is described in greater detail [[Transforming Frozen Competent E. coli\|here]].
