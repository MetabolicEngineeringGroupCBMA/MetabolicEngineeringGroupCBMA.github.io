# LAB7 Gel#3

Summary:
- Run gel with colony PCR products from LAB6
- Inoculate 1 mL yeast cultures for plasmid rescue from liquid medium.
- Prepare solid [[LB]] Lennox medium for LAB8

#### Gel#3 gel on colony PCR products (One per group)

1. Put a piece of gel in a square Petri dish
2. Load 8 µL of the the PCR product.
3. Run the gel for 15 - 20 min in [[TAE]] buffer.

While the gel is running, each group should prepare 250 mL solid [[LB]] Lennox medium in a 500 mL [[glassware\|Schott]] bottle.

See if any of the previously prepared liquid YPD medium (LAB2) is still fresh? Inoculate 1 mL YPD medium in a 2 mL Eppendorf tube from the yeast plate using a sterile pipette tip.

This culture is for plasmid rescue next week.
