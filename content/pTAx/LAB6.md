# LAB6 Colony PCR

[[material#LAB6]]

Summary:
- NaOH total yeast DNA preparation
- Colony PCR
#### NaOH Yeast DNA Preparation
Each student should have a plate with colonies. Do not contaminate this plate, we will need these yeast cells later.

1. Watch this [YouTube](https://youtu.be/_aAQofQHnss) video (2 min) describing the technique.
2. Add 20 µL 20 mM NaOH to a clean 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.
3. Pick a small amount of cells from your plate (from LAB5) with a yellow tip. It is important not to take too much and **no** agarose (see at 52 s in the video).
4. Add the cells to the solution and swirl to mix (see at 59 s in the video).
5. Incubate tubes at 95°C for **ten** minutes.
6. When the 95°C incubation is over, add 180 µL [[TE]] buffer.
7. Vortex the tube for 30 s.
8. Spin at max speed in a micro-centrifuge for 10-20 s.

#### PCR
1. Add **15 µL** of PCR mix<sup>*</sup> to a new PCR tube (these are the small tubes).
2. Add 5 µL of the yeast DNA to the PCR tube, do not disturb the cell debris from the bottom of the tube.
3. Put tubes in PCR machine (or freeze the tubes at -20°C for later).
4. Run this PCR program:
```
Taq DNA pol
|95°C  |95°C               |     |
|______|_____          72°C|72°C |
|10min |30s  \ 53.8°C _____|_____|
|      |      \______/ 0:30|5 min|
|      |          30s      |     |
```
<sup>*</sup> **PCR mix for 25 reactions (15 µL for a 20 µL PCR reaction):**
5. 25 * 13 = 260 µL [[2x PCR mastermix#1.5x Green PCR mastermix (mastermix with PCR compatible loading buffer)\|1.5x Green PCR mastermix]]
6. 25 * 1 µL = 25 µL 1222 (10 µM)
7. 25 * 1 µL = 25 µL 1779 (10 µM)
