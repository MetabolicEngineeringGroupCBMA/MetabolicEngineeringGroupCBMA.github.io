1. # **Assembly of a transcriptional unit using the Yeast Pathway Kit**
This session will show you how to assemble a transcriptional unit vector using the [Yeast Pathway Kit](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26916955). A transcriptional unit is a cassette consisting of a promoter a gene and a terminator. The promoter and terminator will control the transcription of the gene.

The three linear fragments (Promoter, Gene and Terminator) are typically PCR products while the long, curved fragment is a linearized plasmid.  Each fragment share a short identical sequence with another fragment (the colored boxes in the figure). The vector can be assembled by in-vivo homologous recombination in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*.

The first objective is to assemble the sequence for the vector pTA1\_TDH3\_ScATF1\_PGI1. The name indicates that the gene ScATF1 was cloned between the promoter TDH3 and the terminator PGI1 in the plasmid pTA1. The plasmid pTA1 has sequences for replication and selection in both *S. cerevisiae* and *E. coli*. There are four files accompanying this document, containing the sequences for each component.
