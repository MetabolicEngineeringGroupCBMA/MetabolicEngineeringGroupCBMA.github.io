# Saccharomyces Genome Database

Baker’s yeast _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ is both an important model organism for eukaryotic biology and a very important industrial microorganism. The genome sequence was one of the first ever completed (even before _E. coli_) and is still regarded as the one of the highest quality.

_Saccharomyces_ Genome Database (**SGD**), as the name implies, is a database for baker's yeast only. Here we can find the sequence for all yeast genes and a lot of additional information about almost every gene in the organism.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae has 12 linear chromosomes and about 12 Mbp. This is very compact for a eukaryote as this is only about three times the size of the _E. coli_ genome.

Find **SGD** by googling “**sgd**” in your web browser.

You should be able to view a page similar to the one in Fig 1. You can use the search box at the top right corner to search for information.

## Gene nomenclature

Genes in _S. cerevisiae_ have a systematic name with seven letters following the syntax below:

`Y(A-P)(R or L)(NNN)(w/c)`

Y is short for Yeast. A-P is the chromosome number where the gene is located. There are 16 chromosomes designated with the first 16 letters of the alphabet. R or L is the right or left side of the centromere of the chromosome. NNN is a three digit number, counting the genes between this gene and the centromere. w or c Watson or Crick, whether the gene is transcribed from the upper or lower strand of the DNA.

For example **Y**A**R**002**c** is the name of a gene on the first chromosome (A) on the right arm (R) of the chromosome two genes away from the centromere (002) on the crick strand.

**Question 1:**

What is the location of the gene with the systematic name YGR194c? Fill in the table below. Use the same reasoning as for YAR002 above.

| Gene                            | YGR194c |
| ------------------------------- | ------- |
| chromosome                      | ?       |
| number of genes from centromere | ?       |
| direction --> or <--            | ?       |

Many yeast genes have a **standard name** in addition to the systematic name. The standard name is often an acronym that may say something about the function of a gene. The gene **URA3** is a good example of this. Search for URA3 in the search box on the top left corner. You will then see the summary page for this gene (below).

**Question 2:**

What is the systematic name for URA3?

For _S. cerevisiae_ there is a convention to write active genes in upper case like “URA3” and use lower case “ura3” for a gene that is inactive.

See lines two and three in the table below (Table 2 from "[Getting started with yeast](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S007668790250954X)").

## Phenotypic information

There is a link on the left side of the page called “phenotype” (Fig 4). This link will take us to a short text describing the observable consequences of deleting the gene.

 ![[TPs/TP08_Saccharomyces_Genome_Database/TP08_Saccharomyces_Genome_Database_html_c26e1229.png]]_


**Question 3:**

The phenotype of a deletion of the URA3 gene includes [auxotrophy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auxotrophy) for a certain compound. Which one? Read the text at the top of the page after clicking on the “phenotype” link as described above.

**Question 4:**

What is the standard name for gene YCL018W? The deletion of the gene produces auxotrophy for a certain compound, which one?

## Yeast strain genotype description

In the laboratory, mutant strains are most often used. A popular strain is a strain called “CEN.PK2-1C”. It has the genotype described by this string:

`MATa; his3D1; leu2-3_112; ura3-52; trp1-289; MAL2-8c; SUC2`

The `MATa` refers to the mating type, which is this case is a. There are also strains of the α mating type.

**Question 5**

The `CEN.PK2-1C` need four compounds in the growth media which wild-type yeast does not. Which are these four compounds?

Use what you learned about yeast gene nomenclature and how to find phenotype information.
