# Construction of a vector with a c-terminal 6 x his tag

![[TPs/TP23_Fusion_protein_design/TP23_001.png]]
The purpose of this exercise is to construct a vector that expresses a C-terminal GFP fusion protein between S. cerevisiae cytochrome C and GFP. Goal is for the gene to express the cytochrome c open reading frame together with the GFP as one protein.
