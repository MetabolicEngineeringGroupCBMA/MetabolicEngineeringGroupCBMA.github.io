This protocol was adapted from [Lõoke M, Kristjuhan K, Kristjuhan A. Extraction of genomic DNA from yeasts for PCR-based applications. Biotechniques 2011;50:325–8.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3182553/).
According to the authors, it allows amplifying up to 3500 bp PCR products from yeast genomic DNA.

> [!NOTE]
>This appears to be a popular protocol since it has many publications [referring](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?linkname=pubmed_pubmed_citedin&from_uid=21548894) to it. This protocol is one of the most cited in literature. This is an indication that it works well in different labs.

#### Genomic DNA from a liquid yeast culture

1. Spin down 200 μL liquid yeast culture.
2. Remove supernatant.
3. Suspend cells in 100 μL LiOAc (200 mM) containing 1% SDS.
4. Proceed to point 3 below

#### Genomic DNA from a yeast colony on solid medium

1. Pick one yeast colony from a plate.
2. Suspend cells in 100 μL LiOAc (200 mM) with 1% SDS.
3. Incubate for 15 min on a bath of recently boiled water. Original protocol states 5-15 min at 70°C.
4. Add 300 μL 96–100% ethanol, then mix by brief vortexing.
5. Spin down DNA and cell debris at 15,000×g or the max of the centrifuge speed for 3 min.
6. Remove supernatant by decanting or pipetting.
7. Add 1 mL 70% ethanol. Vortex briefly.
8. Spin at the maximum speed that the centrifuge for 30s.
9. Remove ethanol by decanting or pipetting.
10. Dissolve pellet in 100 μL [[TE]], H2O or Elution buffer from a miniprep kit.
11. Spin down cell debris for 15 s or more at maximum speed.
12. Use 1 μL supernatant for PCR.
13. Store the chromosomal DNA at -20°C if it is not to be used immediately.
