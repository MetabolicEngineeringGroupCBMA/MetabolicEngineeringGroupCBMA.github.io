Colaboratory, or “Colab” for short, is a product from Google Research.

Colab allows anybody to write and execute arbitrary python code through the browser, and is especially

well suited to machine learning, data analysis and education.

More technically, Colab is a hosted Jupyter notebook service that requires no setup to use, while providing

access free of charge to computing resources including GPUs.
