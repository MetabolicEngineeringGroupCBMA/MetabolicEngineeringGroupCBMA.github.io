Mini-Sub Cell GT Cell

Fast and flexible, the Mini-Sub cell GT cell is our most popular classroom gel box.
The Mini-Sub cell GT cell holds either a 7 x 7 cm or a 7 x 10 cm gel tray.
A 10 cm agarose gel poured with two 8-well combs easily accommodates two student teams at a time.
At 100 V, this cell resolves DNA fragments from 20–20,000 base pairs in just under 30 min.
