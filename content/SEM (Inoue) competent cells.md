Competent E. coli cells according to the SEM protocol [(Inoue et al. 1990)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2265755) (Inoue) method. Cells prepared using this method can be used according to the [[Transforming Frozen Competent E. coli\|Transforming Frozen Competent E. coli]] protocol. Some details are from this [version](https://bio-protocol.org/bio101/e143).

### How to prepare competent E. coli cells

1. Streak E. coli from a freezer stock on an LB plate ~2 days before the inoculation of the medium. Be sure to streak for isolated colonies.
2. Pick a single bacterial colony (2-3 mm in diameter) and transfer into 25 ml of LB broth or SOB medium in a 250 ml flask.
3. Incubate the culture for 6-8 h at 37 °C with vigorous shaking (250-300 rpm).
4. At about 18:00, use this starter culture to inoculate three 1-L flasks, each containing 200 ml of [[SOB]]. The first flask receives 10 ml of starter culture, the second receives 4 ml, and the third receives 2 ml. Incubate all three flasks overnight at 18-22 °C with moderate shaking.
5. Inoculate 200 ml of [[SOB]] medium in a 1-liter [[glassware\|Erlenmeyer]] flask.
6. Grow to an OD640 = 0.6 at 18°C or at room temperature with vigorous shaking (200-250 rpm) or using a magnetic stirrer bar.
7. Cool the TB buffer on ice for several hours before use.
8. Divide cells into sterile 50 mL FALCON tubes and incubate on ice for 10 minutes to cool down.
9. Spin down cells at 2500 x g (i.e. 3000 rpm Beckman J-6B centrifuge or 3727 rpm in an [Eppendorf 5804R](Eppendorf_5804R.jpg)) for 10 min at +4°C.
The speed using the Eppendorf can be reduced at least as low as 3000 rpm without any problems.
Spinning at lower speed makes it easier to resuspend the cells gently which allegedly improves competency.
10. Resuspend pellet in 60 ml of ice-cold TB (4 x 15 mL) and incubate on ice for 10 minutes, then spin down cells under the same conditions as above.
11. Resuspend pellet gently in 16 ml of TB.
12. Add DMSO to final concentration of 7%, Calculate the needed volume of DMSO like so:


V(DMSO) = 0.07*V(CELLS)/0.93;

V(CELLS) is the volume of cell suspension and V(DMSO) is the DMSO volume to add. Mix gently by swirling.

10. Incubate on ice for 10 minutes.
11. Dispense the cell suspension in 0.2 - 0.5 ml aliquots and immediately flash-freeze by immersion in liquid nitrogen.
12. Store frozen cells at -80°C
### How to prepare TB buffer

Needed glassware:
- One 1L [[glassware\|Schott bottle]]
- One 1000 mL [[glassware\|glass beaker]]
- One 1000 mL [[glassware\|volumetric bottle]]
- One [funnel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funnel)
- One large (>2 cm) magnetic stirrer

Use clean glassware with no detergent residue. Clean glassware with 70% EtOH and let it dry. Glassware can also be autoclaved with some water to achieve the same result. It is best to set aside glassware for competent cell preparation that is not washed with detergent.

1. Prepare a solution (TB w/o Mn) in the 1000 mL beaker with the following components:

- 10 mM Hepes (or Pipes)
- 15 mM CaCl2
- 250 mM KCl

For 1 L (about ten preparations of about 80-100 tubes of competent cells each) this would mean:

- 2.39 g  Hepes (238.3012 g/mol) **or** 3.03 g  Pipes (302.37 g/mol)
- 1.67 g  CaCl2 (110.98 g/mol) **or** 2.21 g CaCl2x2H2O (110.98 g/mol)
- 18.64 g KCl (74.5513 g/mol)

2. Dissolve the salts in ~ 800 mL water a large (1000 mL) glass beaker with a magnetic stirrer.
2. Adjust pH to 6.7 with KOH Potassium hydroxide (56.11 g/mol) 1M solution (‎3.3 g (85%) in 50 mL ).
3. Dissolve dry MnCl2 to have a final concentration of 55 mM. For 1 L this would mean 6.92 g MnCl2 (125.844 g/mol). MnCl2 is hygroscopic so it may stick to paper if used to weigh up the chemical. **VERY IMPORTANT** Add the MnCl<sub>2</sub> **AFTER** adjusting the pH or it will precipitate.

Sterilize the solution by filtration through 0.45 μm filter and store at +4°C. Alternatively, the solution can be made sterile by heating the solution in a microwave oven before adding all the water. Heat for 3-5 min at full power in a microwave oven with the cap shut tightly. Be careful when relieving the pressure. Add autoclaved water up to full volume. The buffer can be stored at 4°C indefinitely. Protocols do not usually recommend autoclaving, but according to this [exchange](https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/15866/what-happens-if-you-autoclave-hepes), it should work as well.






### Transformation Efficiency Test Protocol

1. **Preparation**
   Aliquot 200 μL of competent cells into a pre-chilled microcentrifuge tube.

2. **DNA Addition**
   Add 4 μL of pUC18 plasmid DNA (4.5 ng/μL final concentration) to the cells. Gently flick to mix.

3. **Incubation on Ice**
   Incubate the mixture on ice for 30 minutes.

4. **Heat Shock**
   Heat shock the cells at 42 °C for 45 seconds.

5. **Recovery on Ice**
   Immediately return the tube to ice/water slurry for 2 minutes.

6. **Outgrowth**
   Add 1 mL of LB medium to the tube. Incubate at 37 °C for 1 hour with agitation to allow recovery and expression of antibiotic resistance.

7. **Plating**
   Plate 200 μL and 20 μL of the transformed cells on separate LB agar plates containing ampicillin (LB-amp).
