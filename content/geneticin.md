# Geneticin(G418) stock solution 200 mg/mL (x 1000).

Geneticin (Gibco's brand name) or G418 (generic name) is used to select for yeast that have the KanMX resistance marker.
We make G418 stock solution at 200 mg/ml (1000x) and use a final concentration of [200 μg/ml](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10514571) in solid or liquid media.
The working solution is stored in 1 mL aliquots marked with a capital ***"G"*** at -20°C.
Put these tube is the box marked **"Antibiotics"** in the -20 freezer.
