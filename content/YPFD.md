"On the other hand, phosphoglucose isomerase deletion mutants of S. cerevisiae cannot grow on a pure fructose medium because the phosphoglucose isomerase reaction is the only step catalysing the interconversion of fructose 6-phosphate to glucose 6-phosphate which is an essential metabolite (Aguilera, 1986; Boles et al., 1993). pgi1 mutants can grow on media containing fructose and not more than 0.2% glucose, higher glucose concentrations inhibit growth (Maitra, 1971 ; Ciriacy and Breitenbach, 1979; Aguilera, 1986).

Maitra (1971) assumed that growth inhibition results from an accumulation of toxic concentrations of glucose 6-phosphate. Ciriacy and Breitenbach (1979) suggested that ATP depletion is the cause for the glucose sensitivity. Aguilera (1987) selected pgil suppressor mutants restoring growth on synthetic media with 2% glucose as the sole carbon source.

Recently, Gamo et al. (1993) isolated pgi1 suppressor mutants insensitive to glucose inhibition by selection on media containing 2% fructose and 2% glucose. Suppression of the pgi1 defect depended on a functional respiratory system.

In both cases, the suppressor mutations were interpreted to allow S. cerevisiue pgi1 mutant strains to enhance glucose catabolism through the pentose phosphate pathway and a complete respiratory breakdown. However, the actual functions of the suppressor genes were not identified."
