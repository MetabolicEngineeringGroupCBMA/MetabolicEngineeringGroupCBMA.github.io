Synthetic Dextrose Minimal Medium (SD) also called Synthetic Minimal Glucose Medium or Synthetic Defined (SD). SD is a synthetic minimal medium containing salts, trace elements, vitamins, a nitrogen source, and glucose.

- 1.7 g/L Yeast Nitrogen Base (YNB) **WITHOUT AMINOACIDS AND Ammonium sulfate**
- 20 g/L glucose
- Optional: 20 g/L Agar for **solid** medium

Mix the dry components in a bottle and add water. All components can be autoclaved together.

Plain [[YNB]] has Histidine Methionine and Tryptophan added. This may or not interfere with the experiment.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use the correct Yeast Nitrogen Base!


Alternatively, the medium can be made by combining sterile stock solutions (1L):

- 100 mL [[YNB\|10x YNB]]
- 40 mL [[Glucose\|50% Glucose]]
- Water and optionally agar to 1L

### Adding amino acids

Sometimes yeast strains need amino acid supplementation of growth. Add amino acids [[amino acid drop out mix]].
