1. Watch this [YouTube](https://youtu.be/_aAQofQHnss) video (2 min) describing the technique.
2. Add 20 µL 20 mM NaOH to a clean 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.
3. Pick a small amount of cells from your plate with a yellow tip. It is important not to take too much and **no** agarose (see at 52 s in the video).
4. Add the cells to the solution and swirl to mix (see at 59 s in the video).
5. Incubate tubes at around 95°C for **ten** minutes. This can be done using a plastic bucket and recently boiled water from a [kettle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kettle).
6. When the 95°C incubation is over, add 180 µL [[TE]] buffer.
7. Vortex the tube for 30 s.
8. Spin at max speed in a micro-centrifuge for 10-20 s.
9. Use 5 µL of the supernatant for a 20 µL PCR reaction, do not disturb the cell debris at the bottom of the tube.
10. A standard PCR program can be used without changes.
