This document contain notes and links pertaining to the
master course Genética e Biotecnologia Molecular 2023/2024 given to students attending Mestrado em Bioquímica Aplicada	(MBQA) or Mestrado em Genética Molecular (MGM).

You need to bring a **laptop** computer to this class, and you also need to have a [**Google account**](https://www.google.com/account/about/) and the [[ApE]] plasmid editor app.

Your task is to assemble the sequence of the ATF1 expression vector `pTA1_TDH3_ScATF1_PGI1` using the Yeast Pathway Kit (YPK). The YPK is an assembly protocol developed by the [MEC](https://metabolicengineeringgroupcbma.github.io/) group ([publication](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26916955/)).

## Assembly of the pYPKa_A_ATF1 vector

Your first task is to assemble the pYPKa_A_ATF1 vector. Follow [[in silico assembly of pYPKa_A_ATF1\|these]] instructions to do this.
	
When you have a candidate for the pYPKa_A_ATF1 vector sequence, calculate the cSEGUID checksum for the raw sequence using [SEGUID calculator](http://seguidcalculator.pythonanywhere.com). Modern versions of [[ApE]] also have this functionality.

When you are done, fill in your results in the Google spreadsheet. The link can be found in [Blackboard](https://elearning.uminho.pt/)
## Assembly of the pTA1_TDH3_ScATF1_PGI1 vector

Your second task is to assemble the pTA1_TDH3_ScATF1_PGI1 vector.
You need the pYPKa_A_ATF1 plasmid sequence that you assembled in the previous step to do this. T
This is more complex as it is made by homologous recombination of four DNA fragments.

Follow these [[in silico assembly of pTA1_TDH3_ATF1_PGI1\|instructions]].

When you are done, fill in your results in the Google spreadsheet.

## Yeast transformation
