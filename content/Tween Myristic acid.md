Fatty acid requiring *S. cerevisiae* strains such as *fas1<sup>-</sup>* or *fas2<sup>-</sup>*  needs myristic acid and Tween in the medium to be able to grow.

- 0.5% - 1.0% (v/v) Tween 40 ([PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/92329579))
- 1.3 - 2 mM  myristic acid (**hmy**) ([PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Myristic-Acid))

Tween 40 is the commercial name for Polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monopalmitate.
This compound provides provides palmitic acid (C16).

### Preparation:

1. Heat the bottle containing Tween 40 briefly in the microwave, 15 s.
2. Add Tween 40 to 1/200 of the final medium volume. For example, pipette 1 mL for 200 mL medium.
3. Add 0.460 g/L myristic acid (powder). For example 92 mg to 200 mL.
4. Autoclave the medium.

### Literature Support for the Protocol

*"For the FAS2 knockout strain, the medium contained 2 mM myristic acid with tween 40 (5 g/L) to supplement growth (Chirala et al., [1987](https://analyticalsciencejournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/bit.25021?utm_source=chatgpt.com#bit25021-bib-0009)). The fatty acid supplement was heated to 55°C for 30 min to increase solubility and then filter-sterilized."*
