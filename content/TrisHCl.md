### Tris-HCl

This buffer is commonly used for DNA (pH 8) or RNA (pH 7.5).

For 100 mL of 1M Tris buffer, weigh 12.114 g of Tris base (MW 121.14 g/mol) in a 250 mL beaker, add about 80 mL water and a magnetic stirrer bar.
Set pH to 8.0 or 7.5 with concentrated HCl (**Use Goggles**).
Adjust volume with [[ddH2O]] using a [[glassware\|volumetric flask]].
Transfer solution to a Schott bottle and autoclave to sterilize.

This solution is used for making [[TE]].
