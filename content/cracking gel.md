## procedure

Bacterial colonies of about 1mm size can directly be cracked right after
picking trom the plate (no overnight culture needed). Pick the colony
with a tooth-pick, and resuspend it in 20 µl LB medium or just water (by
vigorously rotating and scraping the pick against wall of the tube).

Add cracking buffer to that 20 ul of bacterial suspension. Put the pick into a
plastic tube with LB and antibiotics for overnight culture (or just inoculate
an LB + antibiotic agar plate at specific position).
