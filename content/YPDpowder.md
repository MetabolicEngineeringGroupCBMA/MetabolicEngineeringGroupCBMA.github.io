YPD medium can be mixed in dry form and used to quickly prepare YPD using a microwave oven. This can be a practical way of storing a YPD stock in dry form.

For 2.5 L final medium:

- 25 g yeast extract
- 50 g peptone
- 50 g glucose

For 500 ml liquid medium, take 25 g of the mix and dissolve in 500 mL tap water add 10g  agar for plates.
Use a 1 L Schott bottle and run for 10 min at full power in a microwave oven with the cap shut *tightly*.

Protect the powder from moisture or the glucose will turn it into a solid paste.
