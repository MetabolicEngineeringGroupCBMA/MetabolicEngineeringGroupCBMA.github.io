Magnesium choride is used in PCR and as a growth medium component for some formulations.
Magnesium chloride comes in two common forms:

- anhydrous 95.211 g/mol
- hexahydrate 203.31 g/mol

Magnesium chloride has a solubility of 529 g/L at 0 °C. This makes about 5M the highest practical stock solution concentration.
