Many consider [reading and listening](https://www.digitalbook.io/blog/read-and-listen-at-the-same-time) to an audiobook to be an effective way to improve vocabulary. I collected free audio books and pdfs of
three short stories below that are examples of good English writing or good writing in general in the case of Franz Kafka.
